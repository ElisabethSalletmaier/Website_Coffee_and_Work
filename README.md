# website_coffee_and_work

I created a web application "coffee and work" with flask. It shows different coffee places that also work as working places. 

Using Rest API the information about the coffee places is extracted from a database and shown on the website. Furthermore people can register, log in and write reviews about the places they've visited. 

The website got deployed with render. You can find it here: https://coffe-and-work.onrender.com/
